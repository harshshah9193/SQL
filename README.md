# A place for SQL code! 


Now, I particularly use PostgreSQL, using pgAdmin 4 dashboard.
You could use Mysql, or other sorts of code that run sql queries. It doesn't matter.
However, there are slight difference in each and I suggest doing research to figure out which one is 
best for you and your situation.
