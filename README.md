# A place to learn some .. *DRUM ROLL* .. SQL! 


Now, I particularly use PostgreSQL, using pgAdmin 4 dashboard.
You could use Mysql, or other sorts of code that run sql queries. It doesn't matter.
However, there are slight differences in each and I suggest doing research to figure out which one is 
best for you and your situation.

Wanna download it? Go [here](https://www.postgresql.org) 

Upon setup, you will need to create a password. *DO NOT FORGET THAT PASSWORD*. You will need it to be able to use pg admin.
